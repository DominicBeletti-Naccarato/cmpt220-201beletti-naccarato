The waterfall method starts with clear and strict requirements for a project. The requirements 
tend to not change throughout the process and are set up front. If any change occurs the hope is that 
it is a minor change. Agile approaches help teams respond to unpredictability through incremental, iterative work cadences
and empirical feedback. It is superior to the waterfall appraosh as it is flexible to change and issues that
arise through the project while allowing prototypes to be finished quicker with less planning.
